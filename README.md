### Hi there üëã

> Note: my Github username changed from metadave to bookshelfdave in late 2021

I'm currently a Principal Lead Software Engineer at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/) ([Linode](https://www.linode.com/)), working on Linode orchestration software (all closed source). I helped ship [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) ([1](https://www.mozilla.org/credits/)), the [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-plugin-framework-is-now-generally-available), [Chef Server](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/), [Chef Analytics](https://www.chef.io/blog/meet-the-chef-analytics-platform), [Habitat](https://community.chef.io/tools/chef-habitat), VLC compiler and Varnish projects at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), and [Riak Multi Data Center Replication](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/latest/using/cluster-operations/v3-multi-datacenter/index.html). 

- I'm interested in:
	- distributed systems
	- programming language theory + functional programming
	- parsing + compilers
	- infrastructure automation
	- polyglot software development
	  - I use C, Python, Terraform, C#, Go, Ruby, Swift, C++ etc.
	  - I ‚ô•Ô∏è Rust, Haskell, Erlang, F#, OCaml, Racket, etc.
	- math + 3d geometry
- Remote worker since 2012
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on
  - compilers + language runtimes
  - cloud infrastructure tooling
  - audio / synth stuff
    - I [play](https://vimeo.com/259783641) [guitar](https://vimeo.com/686513948), although I am not a performer.
